# Functional Requirements

Specification document for BARE_CUA module.

## Overview

This document enumerates the functional requirements that guide implementation, testing, and
quality validation for this project. Each FR has an assigned identifier for cross-reference
in tests, PRs, and architectural documentation.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-BARE_CUA-010

**Description:** Monitoring and observability

**Status:** SCAFFOLD

**Test Traces:** (pending implementation)

---

### FR-BARE_CUA-007

**Description:** User interface components

**Status:** SCAFFOLD

**Test Traces:** (pending implementation)

## Traceability

All tests MUST reference at least one FR using this marker:

```rust
// Traces to: FR-<REPOID>-NNN
#[test]
fn test_feature_name() { }
```

Every FR must have at least one corresponding test. Use the pattern above to link test to requirement.
